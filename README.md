# hello-world
Starting to take my first steps with this tutorial. Objective: create a basic HTML layout for the "Desprogramadas" webpage.
I am a bit overwhelmed by all the steps I need to take before downloading VSCodium into my computer.
It takes a lot side steps to achieve the main objective and to stay on course.
